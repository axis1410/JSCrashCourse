/*
Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a resteraunt.
In his country it is usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 300. If the value is
different, the tip is 20%.

1. Your task is to calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip'
for this. (It is not allwed to use an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary 
operator)

2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip and the final value (bill + tip).
Example : "The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25 and the total value 316.25"

TEST DATA: Test for bill value 275, 40 and 430
